create a express server (any server application)
add dockerfile (look into google "how to dockerise a node app")
push everything to github
go to github actions - we will be using docker image and push it to respository 

in github action --> docker image --> the .yml file
we want to run this workflow on pushing it to main branch only
we want it to run on ubuntu machine
then we want to checkout the code
then we want to login to docker hub to push the image to docker repository
we will be building the docker image (provide the name of repository)
and we will be pushing the image into that repository
the do a git pull as we change it in github repository
(we could have created the same in the local file and had done git push-- both are same)

add your github secrets
in the repository settings --> secrets and variables --> actions --> add your github secrets
username is the docker username not email
password is the docker password
